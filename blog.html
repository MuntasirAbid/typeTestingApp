        What is the Difference between local storage and session storage ?
    </h1>
    <p>
        SessionStorage is similar to localStorage, the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
        data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab
        in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

    <h1>
        What is the difference between Global scope and Block scope ?
    </h1>
    <p>
        A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. Block Scope: A
        variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within
        that particular condition or loop
