        What is the Difference between local storage and session storage ?
    </h1>
    <p>
        SessionStorage is similar to localStorage, the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
        data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab
        in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.
    </p>
    <h1>
        What is the difference between Global scope and Block scope ?
    </h1>
    <p>
        A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. Block Scope: A
        variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within
        that particular condition or loop

        How does the event loop works in JavaScript ?
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
        empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
        effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

    <h1>
        How many ways we might get undefined ?
    </h1>
    <p>
        undefined means, value of the variable is not defined. JavaScript has a global variable undefined whose value is
        "undefined" and typeof undefined is also "undefined". Remember, undefined is not a constant or a keyword.
        undefined is a type with exactly one value: undefined. Assigning a new value to it does not change the value of
        the type undefined.

    <h3>8 Ways to get Undefined:</h3>
    i) A declared variable without assigning any value to it. <br>
    ii) Implicit returns of functions due to missing return statements. <br>
    iii) Return statements that do not explicitly return anything. <br>
    iv) Lookups of non-existent properties in an object. <br>
    v) Function parameters that have not passed. <br>
    vi) Anything that has been set to the value of undefined. <br>
    vii) Any expression in the form of void(expression) <br>
    viii) The value of the global variable undefined
